# SafeDrive Demo

DriveSafe is a research-based mobile application designed to combat phone-induced distracted driving. By integrating Behavioral Economics with Gamification, the app addresses the "Present Bias"—the cognitive tendency of drivers to prioritize the immediate gratification of a smartphone notification over the long-term, uncertain safety of the road.
